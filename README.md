# Flag

The `flag` object module is an object similar in appearance to
[the media object](https://github.com/inuitcss/objects.media), but which
provides slightly more advanced functionality.

Install using Bower:

```sh
$ bower install tree-flag --save
```

Install using npm:

```sh
$ npm install tree-flag --save
```
